# Extracting Census Data from American Community Survey  

This R script helps extract the population percentage estimates by race/ethnicity from the 2017 American Community Survey - Demographic and Housing Estimates for relevant zip codes. This script also includes a way to calculate an entropy value that represents the diversity of different racial/ethnic groups in that particular zipcode (i.e., a way to weigh the number of different racial/ethnic groups) using the package 'philentropy.'

Before using this script, download the 2017 (or latest) American Community Survey - Demographic and Housing Estimates from the US census website. Below is a screenshot of how to access and download the correct dataset file:
